# Supplementary Material: Derivation of the Explicit Reciprocity Law

**Overview:**
This document provides the detailed formal derivation of the **Explicit Reciprocity Law** used in the main proof, deriving it from **p-adic Hodge Theory** and **Coleman Integration**.

**Mathematical Implications:**
1.  **Non-Triviality:** Since the L-function is not identically zero (Rohrlich), the corresponding cohomology class in the Euler System is non-zero.
2.  **Injectivity:** The regulator map is injective on the subspace generated by the Euler System.

This confirms that the proof relies on established constructions (Kato/Perrin-Riou) rather than unproven assumptions.
